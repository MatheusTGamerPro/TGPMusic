        message="To get local formatting use `getDateInstance()`, `getDateTimeInstance()`, or `getTimeInstance()`, or use `new SimpleDateFormat(String template, Locale locale)` with for example `Locale.US` for ASCII dates."
        category="Correctness"
        priority="6"
        summary="Implied locale in date format"
        explanation="Almost all callers should use `getDateInstance()`, `getDateTimeInstance()`, or `getTimeInstance()` to get a ready-made instance of SimpleDateFormat suitable for the user&apos;s locale. The main reason you&apos;d create an instance this class directly is because you need to format/parse a specific machine-readable format, in which case you almost certainly want to explicitly ask for US to ensure that you get ASCII digits (rather than, say, Arabic digits).&#xA;&#xA;Therefore, you should either use the form of the SimpleDateFormat constructor where you pass in an explicit locale, such as Locale.US, or use one of the get instance methods, or suppress this error if really know what you are doing."

        message="Should use &quot;`sp`&quot; instead of &quot;`dp`&quot; for text sizes"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="3"
        summary="Using `dp` instead of `sp` for text sizes"
        explanation="When setting text sizes, you should normally use `sp`, or &quot;scale-independent pixels&quot;. This is like the `dp` unit, but it is also scaled by the user&apos;s font size preference. It is recommend you use this unit when specifying font sizes, so they will be adjusted for both the screen density and the user&apos;s preference.&#xA;&#xA;There **are** cases where you might need to use `dp`; typically this happens when the text is in a container with a specific dp-size. This will prevent the text from spilling outside the container. Note however that this means that the user&apos;s font size settings are not respected, so consider adjusting the layout itself to be more flexible."
